## Complete the following tasks

### 1. Transfer the project to TypeScript

Several additional rules were neccessary in order to compile.

### 2. Create a List Component

This task describes a list format, but doesn't specify it cannot be a table in
order to show all the columns aligned properly, so it's implemented with a table prepared to be styled further.

### 3. Create a Form Generator Component

Done with `react-hook-form`, `zod`, `@hookform/resolvers` for `zod` validation.

### 4. Create a Page Generator Component

Select different dummy layouts from the dropdown for the page generator component.
Page generator is recursive for components that are set up to get children content (like LayoutSection).
NOTE: Generator is made according to requirements examples, so no ReactNode children outside of typed components is allowed.ÃŸ
